# SimpleMDE Markdown Editor for Umbraco

This package is based on the popular [SimpleMDE markdown editor](https://github.com/NextStepWebs/simplemde-markdown-editor). The package adds a new property editor to Umbraco which can be used to add markdown and includes a live preview.

The image upload functionality is hooked into Umbraco's media picker so you can choose and upload images directly from/to Umbraco's media library.

## Getting Started
